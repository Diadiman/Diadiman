Hi 👋 My name is Uchendu Chidiadi
=================================Front-End Developer.--------------------I am Forester as well as an Environmentalist. I have switched careers on different occasions before taking a bold step to the path of coding, which has always being the passion I longed for, as well as going into. The desire to become a Front-End developer was necessitated by the passion I have for coding. I started with HTML, cutting across CSS and JAVA and the scintillating Joy that overwhelms whenever I remember I'm a Front-End developer is an exhilarating one.* 🌍  I'm based in Umuahia* ✉️  You can contact me at [uchenduchidi@yahoo.com](mailto:uchenduchidi@yahoo.com)
